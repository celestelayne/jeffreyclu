### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former architect (buildings!) turned web developer based in Brooklyn, NY. I specialize in building JavaScript full-stack web applications with React and Express.

I'm currently building React Pinpoint, a utility library for testing React component render times against a user-specified threshold.
